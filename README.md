- [HackIIITd - good schedule](https://hack-iiitd.github.io/) (Hero and Nav, simple about, Registeration, Judges, Schedule, Venue, Gallery, Sponsors, FAQ, Team) (nice well organized minimalist website)
- [DSUdevHack - good schedule](https://dsudevhack.tech/) (single page, any extra thing just put in a document and add the link, decent design)
- [nmit hackathon](https://i-solve-final.vercel.app/) (colors were not that good but the hero and moving parts were good)
- [Code Red 2024](https://ecell-bmsit.github.io/codered/) (hero part was not good, very less things in the first page)
